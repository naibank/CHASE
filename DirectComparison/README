This is the analysis where CH events are compared directly between two groups of samples, i.e. probands vs parents, probands vs unaffected siblings, etc.

Hypotheses:
a) Enrichment of CH events in probands compared to parents (MSSNG+SSC)
b) No enrichment of CH events in unaffected siblings compared to parents (SSC)


Please see below for the detail of the directories and the types of scripts they contain.
- burden_analysis - Contains files for performing burden analysis on the data through logistic regression.
	- burden_analysis.R - Perform burden analysis using only inherited deletions and an older model
	- unbiased_burden_analysis.R - Perform burden analysis using all deletions and latest model
	- unbiased_burden_analysis_SPARK.R - Perform burden analysis using all deletions on SPARK data
	- CNV_SV_rate_comparison.R - Plot rate of CH events from CNV caller and SV caller deletions for comparison
	- CNV_SV_rate_comparison_by_individual.R - Plot CH events by total queried exonic deletion size of each individual (also delineated by ASD status)
	- 1000G_SNV_rate_comparison_by_delsize_individual.R - Plot CH events by total queried exonic deletion size of each individual with 1000G dataset
	- Other scripts are for plot generation and investigating data attributes that could possibly explain unexpected results (ex. Looking at distribution of conservation score for synonymous result)

- data_processing - Contains files for getting and processing most of the CH event data (deletions + SNVs) from HPC
	- get_ch_events_xxx.R - Get CNV and SNV data from HPC from xxx dataset (ex. MSSNG)
	- get_sv_xxx.R - Get SV and SNV data from HPC from xxx dataset (ex. MSSNG)
	- process_ch_events_xxx.R - Process each individual's CNV and SNV data into neatly formatted data frames containing CH events from xxx dataset
	- SPARK/ - Same processing scripts but for SPARK dataset
