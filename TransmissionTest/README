This is the analysis where SNVs in nontransmitting parents are tested for an over transmission (i.e. > 50%).

details of files and folders in this subdirectory. NOTE: The latest scripts (Apr 2022) used do not have any dates prefixed to them. Ex. MSSNG/MSSNG_get_CNV_SNV_table.R is the latest script that gets the CH event data frame from the MSSNG dataset from HPC data.

- CRVs/ contains a list of samples harvesting clinically relevant variants and loss-of-function variants in 135 ASD TADA genes.
- gene-sets/ contains gene set information used to perform gene set enrichment analysis
- figures/ contains some results from both MSSNG and SSC.
- preprocessSNVandCNV/ contains scripts to obtain SNVs and CNVs with frequency < 10%. This is the first script to start with
- SNV_count_per_gene/ contains a script to get number of CH event found per gene. This is used to prioritize gene with multiple CH events from multiple samples.
