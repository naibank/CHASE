Association analysis between an individual’s sum of total deleted exonic size and the total number of CH events.
Hypothesis: Probands have higher density of CH events compared to parents (higher count of SNVs in deleted sequence)

a) Probands have more CH events per unit of deleted sequence than parents (Spline approach)
b) Probands have on average shorter total exonic deletion lengths per CH event compared to controls (Z-score approach)
